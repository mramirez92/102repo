            <p>A lot of us fall asleep with the phones in our hands, but the <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side">blue light</a> that emminates from our devices is wreaking havoc on our sleep patterns. Blue light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, that magical sleepy chemical our bodies create naturally. Is that new "House of the Dragon" episode really worth loosing sleep over?

            <p>Our personal internal clock, <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm">Circadium rhythm</a>, work with all of our body systems. It affects so many aspects of our life like mental health, weight loss, immunity, and even DNA repair. Constant shifiting sleep schedules will throw off our little clock.
