            <p>I never appreciated how much sleep was important until, I became a mom. As I watch my six year old change as the days pass, I see how important sleep is to his development and to mine. Snuggling under my blankets is my favorite part of the day. Lately, my sleep schedule has gone off the rails. It has affected me tremendosly. Here are some important tidbits about sleep.</p>

            <p>Sleep is important for the following funcitons:
                <ul><li>memory function</li></ul>
                <ul><li>problem solving</li></ul>
                <ul><li>attention to detail</li></ul>
                Our brains clean out the toxins that were built up during our waking hours, this can only happen when we experience uninterrupted sleep.</p>

            <p>We all love to be on our phones, but the blue light that emminates from our beloved devices is wreaking havoc on our sleep patterns. Blue light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, that magical sleepy chemical our bodies create naturally. Is that new "House of the Dragon" episode really worth loosing sleep over? Crunchyroll will have all your episodes for you to watch during the day, choose sleep!</p>

            <p>Our personal internal clock, Circadium Rhythyms, work with all of our body systems. It affects so many aspects of our life like mental health, weight loss, immunity, and even DNA repair. Constant shifiting sleep schedules will throw off our little clock. When you say "I'm dead tired" part of your brain is partially turned off. Be nice to your brain and your body. The biggest self love you can show is by taking care of yourself. </p>
